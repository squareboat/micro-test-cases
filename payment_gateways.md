1. Failed payment case should be handled
1. Unknown payment status case should be handled.
1. Cart should get cleared when payment and order is successful.
1. Customers should get an order confirmed email/message or both.
1. Success screen should clearly mention that order has been successful and should also mention a unique Order ID for later reference by the customer (if needed)
1. Payment gateway form should be auto filled up as per the profile information available in our database.
1. [Optional] Incase of failure, the user should be asked to reattempt the payment using a different gateway.
